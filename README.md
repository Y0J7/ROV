# Atlas Innovators ROV

**Atlas Innovators ROV** is the official repository for the Atlas Innovators Team's Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) project. The team is dedicated to excellence in underwater robotics, aiming to achieve top performance in competitions and advance the field through innovation.

## Overview

This repository contains the software components for controlling and interfacing with the team's ROV. It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) and control logic to operate the vehicle effectively during missions and testing.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Provides an intuitive interface for operators to control the ROV and monitor its status.
- **Control Logic**: Implements the necessary algorithms and protocols to manage the ROV's movements and functions.
- **Modular Design**: Organized codebase to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.

## Repository Structure

- `GUI/`: Contains the source code for the graphical user interface.
- `ROV/`: Includes the core control logic for the ROV.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `welcome.md`: Additional information or welcome message for users and contributors.

## Getting Started
